# ATM-Machine-Banking-System
The given project code appears to be a program for a banking system. It includes several classes and functions to perform various banking operations such as signup, login, balance inquiry, cash withdrawal, funds transfer, and bill payments.

The program starts with including the necessary libraries and defining a global variable for the account balance. It also includes a class named Login, which handles the signup and login functionality. The Bank class inherits from the Login class and includes functions for different banking operations. Additionally, there are classes for PIN change, fast cash withdrawal, cash withdrawal, balance inquiry, funds transfer, and payments.

The main() function is not included in the given code, so it is not possible to determine the program flow or how these classes and functions are being used. However, based on the code provided, it seems to be a basic banking system implementation with functionality for managing user accounts and performing common banking operations.
